What determines the location of dance studios in New York City?

As an artform that organizes both time and space, dance has particular needs not only for its performance, but also for its creation. Dance needs spaces in which to be created, spaces which can approximate the spaces in which it will be performed.

The following visualizations attempt to consider how these spaces impact dance creation. But it's not directly considering the studios themselves; it's not the space *of* the dance studios, but the *location* of the studios — an aspect of space "once-removed," we might say. A vital element for the creation of dance, how do the locations of dance studios get determined, and what can this tell us about dance itself?

## The Visualizations

What follows is a series of visualizations that help point to one factor that may have determined the location of dance studios in New York City.

First, a map with a number of dance spaces. Mostly studios, and some theaters:

In the above image, all the dots represent spaces that are associated with dance. In most cases, these are explicitly dance studios. In some cases, they are other kinds of spaces — Churchs, community centers — that have otherwise been significant as resources for supporting dance practice. Some of the dots also represent theaters — spaces that are used primarily to present performances of dance.

One theory would be that dance studios would be more likely to appear closer to theaters — that places where dance gets made might more easily thrive near the places that dance gets performed. In order to test this theory, first we'll visually distinguish the theater spaces:

With the theaters visually distinguished, we see that they generally congregate in lower Manhattan. This is already well-known anecdotally, and doesn't need a map to prove it. However, we can use this map to quickly identify a few other relationships between theaters and studios:
