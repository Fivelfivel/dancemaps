What determines the location of dance studios in New York City?

As an artform that organizes both time and space, dance has particular needs not only for its performance, but also for its creation. Dance needs spaces in which to be created, spaces which can approximate the spaces in which it will be performed.

The following visualizations attempt to consider how these spaces impact dance creation. But it's not directly considering the studios themselves; it's not the space *of* the dance studios, but the *location* of the studios â€” an aspect of space "once-removed," we might say. A vital element for the creation of dance, how do the locations of dance studios get determined, and what can this tell us about dance itself?
