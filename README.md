# Dancemaps

This is an evolving collection of GIS and mapping experiments related to dance studios in New York City.

Currently, the folder `/qgis_maps` contains *test-case explorations of the open source program [QGIS](http://www.qgis.com). See the file `/qgis_maps/GIS_and_dancestudios.md` file for an explanation of the maps contained in that folder.

*By "test-case" is meant that the examples are testing various approaches to analyzing and visualizing the data, rather than attempting to provide precise answers. In short, this is because the data collected so far is not uniformly categorized nor rigorously choosen â€” the methodology for determining which studios should be included, and how to categorize them, still needs plenty of work. So while this dataset is sizable enough to give a useful representation of what might be revealed by different GIS analyses, the current visualizations are not, at this point, intended to present definitive conclusions.
